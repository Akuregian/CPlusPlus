<h1>Polynomail class will used linked lists</h1>
 * 		to store polynomails such as p(x) = 5x^10 + 9x^7 - x - 10 as (5, 10),(9, 7),(-1, 1),(10, 0). Member function will be added to add, mulitply and print polynomails.
 * 		Also Polynomial consutructors can make a single term using Polynomial(Term(-10, 0));
